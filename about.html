        Hello dear viewers, my name is <span>Akhilesh lal</span>.
        You are currently on a clone of spotify which is made by me. This is my first clone that I have made using HTML,
        CSS and Javascript. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of front-end web development and user 
        interface design. I have tried to make the clone as much responsive I can by the best of my understanding about
        media queries.
        Some of the improvements I will definitely make in coming days:
        <ul>
            <li>1. Adding backend to manage user authentication, store playlists, and retrieve music data from a database.</li>
            <li>2. Connect to actual music streaming APIs for more realistic experience. </li>
        </ul>
